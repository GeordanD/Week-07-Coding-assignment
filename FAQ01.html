<h1><b>What is color cast?</b></h1>

<p>A color cast is an unwanted tint in the image due to the lighting, the white balance of the camera and mixed lighting situations,<br> for example if you have the lights on in a room but you also have lighting coming in from <br> Color casts aren’t usually uniform across an entire image. Often, color casts are stronger in one portion of the image <br> (such as the highlights) and weaker or nonexistent in others (the shadows, for example).</p>
<p>This causes the image to look a color that the room is not in person.</p>
<p>Here at ChaseCapture, we go over the images with great detail, making them look as true as the room looks in real life!</p>
<p>Have you ever seen something like this yellowish photo below when you use your point and shoot camera? Read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_cast"> about color casts</a> here.</p>

            <figcaption>Here is after I changed the color cast. Notice how all the oranges and yellows are gone and the doors look as white as they would be in person.</figcaption>
