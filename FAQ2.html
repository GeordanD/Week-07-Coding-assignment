    <h1><b>What is HDR photography?</b></h1>

    <p>HDR stands for High Dynamic Range, the camera is set up on a tripod to take three shots in a row. <br> One of the images is normal exposure (normal lighting), one is darker, and one is really bright. <br> The pictures are then processed with special software that blends the 3 exposures together. <br> Blending them together makes a HDR photo and reveals the best of each exposure, the darks, lights, and normal lighting. <br> This makes the image more similar to what you would see with the human eye when standing in the room.</p>
    <p>In other words, in a normal photo there are areas where the photo is too light or too dark. <br> In the darker exposed images, it brings down the brightness of it all. <br> In the light exposure images, you can see the dark areas better. <br> So blending all these together makes for a perfect image where no areas are too bright and no areas are too dark! <br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-exposure_HDR_capture">For more information on HDR check out this resource.</a></p> <img src="http://www.chasecapture.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/35-L.jpg" alt="image using HDR">
