    <h1>Hi there! I’m Chase Kunkel</h1>
    <p>I love shooting homes and making people see how fantastic their space is. <br> All this means the houses that I shoot for Real Estate receive more showings and therefore sell faster. I have photographed 1000s of homes in the Valley.<br> I like to stay cutting edge with the latest technology and developments in photography so my learning never ends.</p>
    <p>Some of my other interest cycling, acoustic guitar and shooting astrophotography (stars).</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<ul>
    <li>What is color cast?</li>
    <p>A color cast is an unwanted tint in the image due to the lighting, the white balance of the camera and mixed lighting situations, for example if you have the lights on in a room but you also have lighting coming in from outside. Color casts aren’t usually uniform across an entire image. Often, color casts are stronger in one portion of the image (such as the highlights) and weaker or nonexistent in others (the shadows, for example).</p>
    <li>What is HDR?</li>
    <p>HDR stands for High Dynamic Range, the camera is set up on a tripod to take three shots in a row. One of the images is normal exposure (normal lighting), one is darker, and one is really bright. The pictures are then processed with special software that blends the 3 exposures together. Blending them together makes a HDR photo and reveals the best of each exposure, the darks, lights, and normal lighting. This makes the image more similar to what you would see with the human eye when standing in the room.</p>
    <li>How much am I going to spend on this?</li>

    <li>How do I get ready for my photo Shoot?</li>
    <p>In preparation for your photo shoot we’ve compiled a quick list of tips and guidelines to make it a success and to speed up the process.

The photo shoot will take approximately 60-90 minutes and can vary depending on the house.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Open all blinds and shutters throughout the house, the more natural light the better!</li>
            <li>Turn on all the lights in every room including table lamps and accent lights, if you have spare bulbs, replace the burned out ones</li>
            <li>Clear counter tops and table surfaces leaving only decorating items</li>
            <li>Spot clean any mirrors</li>
            <li>Remove any personal items you don’t want photographed and shown online</li>
            <li>Make sure all toilet seats are closed</li>
            <li>Turn off all ceiling fans</li>
            <li>If you have a pool vacuum, we recommend that you remove it for the shoot</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The goal is to show as much of your home as possible to home buyers looking online. If its not tucked away in a closet or hiding in the attic, there is a very good chance it will be photographed.

During the photo shoot the photographer will use a wide angle lens. Using this type of lens provides excellent photos, but it also means capturing everything and everyone in sight. If you can see the camera, it can see you and it will be photographing you. If you’re in the frame/photo the photographer will let you know. For the most part expect to be in a different room or behind the photographer during the photo shoot.

Once the photographer starts shooting you are welcome to hang out or hide out. We understand it can be a little awkward trying to keep a conversation going when the two people are in different rooms.

Depending on the type of processing chosen, photos take from 1 to 3 days to process. Once they are ready you will be provided an online gallery to view your photos.</p>
